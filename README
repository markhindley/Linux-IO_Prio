Linux-IO_Prio version 0.01
========================

Linux-IO_Prio is a perl module which is a thin wrapper around ioprio_get(2) and
ioprio_set(2).

Currently there is Linux support. Other operating systems are not supported due
to kernel limitations. However support will be added as the kernel capability
becomes available.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires only core modules. However it does require a valid
syscall.ph file which is more dependant on the vendor distribution
